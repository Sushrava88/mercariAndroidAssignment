# **Appium-Based Automation Framework with Java 8, BDD, and Cucumber**

## **Project Overview**

This project is an Appium-based automation framework designed for mobile application testing using **Java 8**, **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)** with **Cucumber**, and **TestNG**. It supports functionalities such as adding items to a shopping cart, verifying cart contents, completing the checkout process, and validating screen transitions with proper handling for network delays.

---

## **Features**

- **BDD Implementation:**  
  Tests are written in Gherkin syntax, enabling better readability and collaboration between technical teams and business stakeholders.

- **Screen Transition Handling:**  
  Ensures seamless navigation and interactions with custom wait methods, logging, and dynamic handling of network delays.

- **Reusable Components:**  
  Implements design patterns like the **Page Object Model (POM)** to ensure maintainability and reduce redundancy.

- **Data-Driven Testing:**  
  Externalizes input data, such as user credentials and address details, using configuration files or data sources to enhance flexibility.

- **Assertion and Validation:**  
  Includes assertions to validate actions like successful screen transitions, item additions, and purchase completion.

- **Scalability:**  
  Designed to easily accommodate new features, screens, and test cases, ensuring the framework evolves with the application.

## **Reason for Choosing BDD Framework Approach**

1. **Collaboration:**  
   BDD fosters collaboration between technical and business teams, ensuring alignment with requirements.

2. **Universal Language:**  
   Gherkin syntax is easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

3. **Business Value Focus:**  
   Helps to clearly map test scenarios to business requirements.

4. **Partnership Across Teams:**  
   Encourages active collaboration among Business Analysts, Stakeholders, QA, and Developers.

5. **Separation of Concerns:**  
   Test cases are written separately from the test code for better maintainability.

6. **Reusability:**  
   Supports reusable step definitions and POM components.

7. **Aspect-Oriented Controls:**  
   Simplifies modularizing cross-cutting concerns like logging and reporting.

8. **Streamlined Reviews:**  
   Easy-to-understand test cases make code reviews simpler and faster.

9. **Clarity and Shift-Left Approach:**  
   Encourages early detection of issues, reducing overall costs.

10. **Maintainability:**  
    A modular and scalable design ensures that the framework can grow with the project.
