Appium-Based Automation Framework with Java 8, BDD, and Cucumber
Project Overview
This project is an Appium-based automation framework designed for mobile application testing using Java 8, Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) with Cucumber, and TestNG. 
It supports functionalities such as adding items to a shopping cart, verifying cart contents, completing the checkout process, and validating screen transitions with proper handling for network delays.

Features
BDD Implementation:
Tests are written in Gherkin syntax, enabling better readability and collaboration between technical teams and business stakeholders.

Screen Transition Handling:
Ensures seamless navigation and interactions with custom wait methods, logging, and dynamic handling of network delays.

Reusable Components:
Implements design patterns like the Page Object Model (POM) to ensure maintainability and reduce redundancy.

Data-Driven Testing:
Externalizes input data, such as user credentials and address details, using configuration files or data sources to enhance flexibility.

Assertion and Validation:
Includes assertions to validate actions like successful screen transitions, item additions, and purchase completion.

Scalability:
Designed to easily accommodate new features, screens, and test cases, ensuring the framework evolves with the application.

Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Java 8
Maven 3.6 or higher
For dependency management and build automation.
Appium Server and Appium Java Client:
For executing mobile application tests on Android/iOS devices or emulators.
Cucumber and TestNG:
For BDD implementation and test execution.
IDE:
(e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse) for development and debugging.

Technologies Used
Programming Language: Java 8
Testing Framework: Cucumber with TestNG
Automation Tool: Appium
Build Tool: Maven
Reporting: Extent Reports
Reason for Choosing BDD Framework Approach
Collaboration:
BDD fosters collaboration between technical and business teams, ensuring alignment with requirements.

Universal Language:
Gherkin syntax is easy to understand for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

Business Value Focus:
Helps to clearly map test scenarios to business requirements.

Partnership Across Teams:
Encourages active collaboration among Business Analysts, Stakeholders, QA, and Developers.

Separation of Concerns:
Test cases are written separately from the test code for better maintainability.

Reusability:
Supports reusable step definitions and POM components.

Aspect-Oriented Controls:
Simplifies modularizing cross-cutting concerns like logging and reporting.

Streamlined Reviews:
Easy-to-understand test cases make code reviews simpler and faster.

Clarity and Shift-Left Approach:
Encourages early detection of issues, reducing overall costs.

Maintainability:
A modular and scalable design ensures that the framework can grow with the project.
